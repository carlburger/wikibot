        Wikibot provides content from websites operated by Wikimedia Foundation Inc. for use in chat systems. It posts abstracts of Wikipedia content into chats if it receives chat messages which are used as search queries for Wikipedia pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wikibot does not take any responsibility regarding the Wikipedia content used in its chat messages. If there are abstract paragraphs on a matching Wikipedia page these paragraphs are only processed for readability. Otherwise the content stays unchanged.

        Wikibot does not share your data with third parties. The only data Wikibot uses are your chat messages directed at Wikibot. These are sent as a search string to one of the official Wikipedia sites operated by Wikimedia Foundation Inc. The response to the search string is then parsed for an abstract paragraph which is posted back into the chat. If no direct match for the search is found Wikibot parses for suggestions and posts these back into the chat.
